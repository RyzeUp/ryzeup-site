        <p class="landing-desc">Here is our project RyzeUp. Intended to show the connections and networks in the
            political
            system of the US, it
            displays information in a easy to see, interactive, and fluid way. Allows for users to go through and see
            their
            representatives, look at bills, read user explanations and comments, and see what their representative is
            actually a
            part of.</p>
